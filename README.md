## Project 4

### The rules of the trivia game are simple. Each question is worth 5 points each. 20 total questions with a perfect score pf 100 points. Each question must be answered in order to get a score.

### The purpose of this project was to create a familiar game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I implemented DOM manipulation to act as the score counter.
